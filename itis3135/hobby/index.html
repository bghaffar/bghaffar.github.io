        <p>Hi, my name is Bita! and I am a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). 
            I realized that whenever I took a break from studying, I wanted to relax with a fun game that was actually beneficial. 
            Instead of wasting my time scrolling on social media, I figured why not combine relaxation with learning? 
            That is when I decided to create Geography Games, a platform where I could make the best use of my downtime and at the same time help others do the same.
